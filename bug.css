The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a pseudo-element's content property is not working as intended. It uses the `::before` pseudo-element to add some text before an element but it does not work because of a missing content declaration.  It leads to unexpected behavior or no visible effect.:

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 10px;
}

div::before {
  content: "Text should appear here";
}
```
